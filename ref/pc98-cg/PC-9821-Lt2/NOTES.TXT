Straightforward enough, but there's some odd behavior in this capture.

Doublewide columns 0x5D-0x7F are undefined and latch random data.
Column 0x58 is also undefined.

Columns 0x56-0x57 (user defined) should be empty but something appears
to populate those cells on startup (Windows 95? MS-DOS 6.2?)

Rows 0x01-0x1F appear to be aliases of rows 0x20-0x7F, except the
columns are shifted over, and appear to reflect various columns from
rows further down as the columns count from left to right.
