Bugs with DOSBox-X and Windows NT 3.1

- The ET4000 SVGA driver changes the upper-left most text cell purple on
  the NT boot screen

- In low memory conditions (memsize=12) DOSBox's dynamic core will likely
  segfault at some point at some unexpected time. This does not happen
  when larger amounts of memory are given (memsize > 16).
