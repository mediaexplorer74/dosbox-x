It is possible to install Windows ME properly without crashing. It requires
some workarounds and changing parameters per boot, but it is possible.

1. Boot into a disk image with a base DOS os on it (MS-DOS 6.22 or Win 9x
   DOS mode). your dosbox.conf should have core=dynamic and IDE emulation
   enabled. Make sure the v86io hack is enabled so that Windows ME can
   use the same INT 13h detection method to enable it's IDE driver.
   Also make sure that apmbios=false at this stage so that Windows ME
   does not install the APM driver (which is incompatible with DOSBox
   and can be a major source of BSODs).

2. Run the first setup phase of the Windows ME setup program. When it
   reboots, shut down the DOSBox emulator. Do NOT let it boot.

3. Change your dosbox.conf to core=normal or core=full. Start DOSBox
   and let Windows ME run through it's setup and autodetection.
   This will take a long time because you are not using the dynamic
   core. But because of some issues with the dynamic core and some
   floating point tests carried out by Setup, you cannot use the
   dynamic core at this stage.

4. When the setup and detection phase is complete, let Windows ME
   reboot. It will begin the normal desktop, but may insist on
   running the Setup and autodetection phase again before allowing
   the desktop to show. When the desktop finally appears, shut
   down Windows ME.

5. Edit your dosbox.conf to change core=dynamic. You may also
   set apmbios=true at this point if you want Windows shutdown
   to close DOSBox automatically---but make sure you do not allow
   WinME to install the APM driver!

Alternative method (faster): Run Windows ME setup with core=dynamic.
Let it go as far as it can. When you can no longer proceed without
crashing, reboot WinME into safe mode, force your way to the desktop,
and use regedit.exe to delete all startup keys from registry location
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

This will allow Windows ME to boot, though with a lot of missing
driver functionality. It is very likely in this mode that you will
forever be stuck in 640x480 16-color mode, and every time you boot,
Windows ME will complain the display is not configured correctly and
any attempt to remedy that will fail (evil voice) MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR BEING SO IMPATIENT SUCKER!
