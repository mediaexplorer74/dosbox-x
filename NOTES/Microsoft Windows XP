1. Install MS-DOS 6.22 first.

2. Use MS-DOS to run the NT installer.
   The floppy-based install will not work with NT, because DOSBox-X
   does not yet emulate the floppy controller.

NOTE: The installer goes as far as copying some base files, then appears
      to hang, or spit out a spurious error message. I'm not sure what's
      wrong.
