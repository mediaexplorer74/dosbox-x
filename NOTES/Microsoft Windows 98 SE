* When installing Windows 98 or 98SE in DOSBox:

  Use core=dynamic for a faster install.

  For the first phase of the install, make sure
  you set:

  dynamic core cache block size=32

  Let it install then reboot. Stop the emulation
  before it starts booting again, and change it to:

  dynamic core cache block size=1

  For the rest of the install, leave it at that
  setting.

  The setup phase may show some invalid page fault
  dialog boxes (for some reason). If you ack them,
  Windows will make it through the install and
  boot up properly.

  Do not change the dynamic core cache block size
  back to 32. Windows 98 will become unstable and
  DOSBox will likely segfault at some point, usually
  when opening the Control Panel.
