Tempest 2000 will generally work fine in DOSBox-X.

You will need to enable expanded memory.

Known issues:

1. If you have dynamic kernel allocation enabled,
   and you have most of the private data in the umb,
   you will need to at least enable the "loadfix padding"
   memory block for the game to start properly. If
   you start the game and it stays at a black screen,
   try enabling the loadfix padding option.

   UPDATE: Tempest 2000 fails to startup if the first MCB
           of the chain starts at 0x69 or lower. You can
           leave off "loadfix padding" if you set the
           "minimum mcb segment" value to 0x6A or higher.
