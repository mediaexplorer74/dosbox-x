1. Install MS-DOS 6.22 first.

2. Use MS-DOS to run the NT installer.
   The floppy-based install will not work with NT, because DOSBox-X
   does not yet emulate the floppy controller.

3. Let DOSBox-X restart

4. Let NT Boot.

   NOTE: At this time, NT is unable to get past the boot screen and
   displays a crash dump with INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE. debug information
   seems to imply that NT's IDE driver is having difficulty issuing
   a sector read---debug info shows IDE command 20h is issued... long
   pause... another one is issued... eventually NT gives up.
