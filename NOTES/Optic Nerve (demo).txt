Optic Nerve

Requirements:
 - xms=false (the demo will not start if HIMEM.SYS is present)
 - extended memory (4MB at least)
 - at least cycles count 12000
 - Sound Blaster sound card

Demo comments:
 - As commented widely on Pouet.net, this demo is very hard to run on real
   hardware.

 - MS-DOS 6.x and higher tend to force HIMEM.SYS into memory. To run the demo,
   you will need to hit F8 on boot. MS-DOS 6.22 will confirm every action it
   will take, and Windows 95 will show the boot menu where you will select
   "confirm each action". Answer "N" to each question, and you will get a
   minimal MS-DOS environment without HIMEM.SYS.

 - Whether or not the demo works seems to vary widely depending on what
   version of MS-DOS you are running.

   DOSBox/DOSBox-X native shell:      Runs all the way through.
                                      Demo has issues clearing the screen between parts, VGA emulation bug?
                                      Some transitions cause the music to skip forward.

   MS-DOS 7.0:                        Does not run at all, hangs at black screen

   MS-DOS 7.1:                        Does not run at all. On a Compaq 486 with Win98 DOS, demo causes laptop to immediately reboot.

   MS-DOS 6.22:                       Runs fine. VGA emulation is even able to clear the screen properly.
                                      One transition (from the rotating gourad face) causes the music to skip forward.
                                      The rotating gourad face also fails to capture a "screenshot".

   MS-DOS 5.0:                        Runs fine. VGA emulation is even able to clear the screen properly.
                                      The rotating gourad face also fails to capture a "screenshot".
                                      No music skipping observed. Music and video seem to run slightly at a
                                      slightly slower rate (or is that just me?)
