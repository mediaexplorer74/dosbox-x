"Dope" demo notes
 - PIT 0 timer runs at a constant 72.503Hz. Hacking it to run faster (421Hz for example)
   however actually makes the demo run slower!
 - The demo appears to use an alternate time source for it's music, perhaps interrupts
   from the GUS?

"Dope" demo bugs (not DOSBox's fault)
 - Hitting spacebar during the blue-greenish rotating blob just after the spinning "C"
   logo part does NOT cause the demo to exit. It causes the demo to jump immediately
   to the fire clouds section, render a glitchy cross-fade between what was on the
   screen and the clouds, then, once the fire clouds complete, the demo exits. Weird.
