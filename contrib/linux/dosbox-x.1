emulator.
.LP 
.LP 
Options are listed below. Depending on the option, one or more may be specified.
.LP 
The optional \fBNAME\fR argument should be a DOS executable or a
directory. If it is a dos executable (.com .exe .bat), the program will 
run automatically. If it is a directory, a DOS session will run with 
the directory specified mounted as the C:\\ drive.
If the dos executable requires parameters, enclose the command and 
it's parameters in quotes.
.LP 
For an introduction type \fIINTRO\fR inside dosbox\-x.

.RE
\fB\-securemode\fR
.RS
Enable secure mode, which is meant to prevent a DOS program potentially gaining
access to files outside directories mounted in the [autoexec] section of the
config file. It does this by running \fBZ:\\SYSTEM\\CONFIG.COM \-securemode\fR
after completing the [autoexec] section (which in turn disables any changes to
how the drives are mounted "inside" dosbox). It also disables various other
CONFIG.COM options that could be exploited.

.RS
Skips the [config] section of the loaded configuration file. This is equivalent to CONFIG.SYS in DOS.
.RE

.RE
\fB\-exit\fR

.RE
\fB\-c \fIcommand\fR
.RS
Runs the specified \fIcommand \fRbefore running \fBNAME\fR. Multiple
commands can be specified. Each \fIcommand\fR should start with \fB\-c\fR
though. A command can be an Internal Program, a DOS command or an executable on
a mounted drive. If the command requires parameters, enclose the command and
its parameters in quotes.
.RE
\fB\-set \fIsection property=value\fR
.RS
Set the config option (override any config file). If the property contains
spaces, ensure to enclose the string in quotes. The section is the name of a
dosbox\-x config section such as [video] without the brackets. Multiple \fB\-set 
\fR commands may be specified. If a property is unique, the section may be
ommitted. e.g. \fB\-set dosbox machine=hercules\fR is equivalent to
\fB\-set machine=hercules\fR
.RE
\fB\-time\-limit\fIn\fR
.RS
Kill the emulator after\fI\'n'\fR seconds.
.RE
\fB\-fastlaunch\fR
.RS

Saved/recorded files can be found in current_directory/capture
(can be changed in the configfile). The directory has to exist prior to starting
dosbox\-x else nothing gets saved or recorded!

maximum capacity, it will produce the same effect as slowing down the emulation.
This maximum will vary from computer to computer, there is no standard.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Any configuration option can be overridden using an environment variable.
Environment variables starting with prefix \fBDOSBOX\fR are processed and
interpreted as follows:
